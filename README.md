ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
This project focuses on predicting whether a person is diabetic based on certain medical attributes using machine learning algorithms. It utilizes a publicly available dataset from Kaggle and demonstrates the complete ML pipeline from data preprocessing to model deployment with an interactive UI built using Gradio.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset used is the Diabetes Database from Kaggle. It consists of 768 observations with 8 independent variables and 1 target variable. The attributes include:
Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history
Age: Age in years
Outcome: Class variable (0: Non-diabetic, 1: Diabetic)

ðŸ§  Machine Learning Models Used
Three machine learning models were trained and evaluated:


Model	Accuracy Score
Logistic Regression	0.7857
Decision Tree Classifier	0.7143
Random Forest Classifier	0.7792
Based on accuracy score, Logistic Regression was selected as the best performing model.

ðŸš€ Deployment
The best model (LogisticRegression) was deployed using Gradio to create an interactive web UI for real-time diabetes prediction.
Users can input the values for medical attributes and get an instant prediction on whether the person is likely to have diabetes.
